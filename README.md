## Project Overview
This project is a weather information web application built as part of the Appgain.io frontend evaluation task. The application allows users to search for real-time weather data by entering a city's name, and it displays key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Technologies Used
React: The application is built using React to ensure a modular and component-based structure, making the code scalable and easy to maintain.
Redux: Although the app is small, Redux was implemented to showcase proficiency in managing application state effectively. It ensures scalable state management, especially when handling asynchronous API calls.
TypeScript: TypeScript was used for added type safety, improving code reliability and reducing potential runtime errors.
CSS: The application was styled using pure CSS to maintain a lightweight and clean design. The focus was on making the UI responsive and user-friendly across different devices.
OpenWeather API: Weather data is fetched using the OpenWeather API, providing accurate and current weather information based on the user's input.
## Features
Search Functionality: Users can enter a city's name in a search bar, and upon submitting, the application retrieves and displays the weather data.
Error Handling: If the city is not found or if thereâ€™s a network issue, the application provides user-friendly error messages.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.
## Why Redux?
While the app is relatively small, Redux was incorporated to demonstrate my proficiency with global state management. Redux helps manage the weather data fetched from the API efficiently, and it prepares the application for future scalability where more complex state handling could be required.
